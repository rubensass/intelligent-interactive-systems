description:
Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brene Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives.  It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth  and trust  in our organizations, families, schools, and communities. ...more
