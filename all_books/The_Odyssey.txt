Literature s grandest evocation of life s journey, at once an ageless human story and an individual test of moral endurance, Homer s ancient Greek epic The Odyssey is translated by Robert Fagles with an introduction and notes by Bernard Knox in Penguin Classics.When Robert Fagles  translation of The Iliad was published in 1990, critics and scholars alike hailed it as a mas Literature s grandest evocation of life s journey, at once an ageless human story and an individual test of moral endurance, Homer s ancient Greek epic The Odyssey is translated by Robert Fagles with an introduction and notes by Bernard Knox in Penguin Classics.When Robert Fagles  translation of The Iliad was published in 1990, critics and scholars alike hailed it as a masterpiece. Here, one of the great modern translators presents us with The Odyssey, Homer s best loved poem, recounting Odysseus  wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile, the  man of twists and turns  meets the challenges of the sea god Poseidon, and monsters ranging from the many headed Scylla to the cannibalistic Cyclops Polyphemus   only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife Penelope s suitors. In the myths and legends retold in this immortal poem, Fagles has captured the energy of Homer s original in a bold, contemporary idiom.Seven greek cities claim the honour of being the birthplace of Homer (c. 8th 7th century BC), the poet to whom the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey are attributed. The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Western literature, but the identity   or even the existence   of Homer himself is a complete mystery, with no reliable biographical information having survived.If you enjoyed The Odyssey, you might like Robert Fagles  translation of The Iliad, also available in Penguin Classics.
