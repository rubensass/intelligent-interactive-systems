Spending three decades in love with a wonderful but unattainable man is pretty high up on her list of missteps, as is a long line of unsuccessful love affairs accompanied by a seemingly endless supply of delicious cocktails.When the young bride flees  taking with her a family heirloom and leaving behind six hundred bewildered guests  her mother offers Margo fifty grand to retrieve her spoiled brat of a daughter and the invaluable property she stole.
