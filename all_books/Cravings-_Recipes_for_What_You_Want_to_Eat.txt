Stylish but brash, witty and big-hearted, Chrissy cooks beautifully, but with the spirit of the amateur. In this book, she shows us how to make cooking part of a stylish lifestyle and how to look good doing it…or at least how to laugh at ourselves if we don’t.“The thing that makes me happiest isn’t when people stop me in the street to say they saw me in a magazine, but when they say they were inspired to cook because of what I posted on Instagram,” Chrissy Teigen says.
