There are so many moments in life when we choose to silence our intuition, abandon our own voice, and play small because we wonder, deep down:  Do I know who I really am? Is who I really am enough?

Is who I really am enough?  It s courageous work to learn to live from our essential identity  loved, worthy, whole. But what if God is calling us to shamelessly recover the woman he created us to be? What if God is urging us to be  for the first time in our lives  brazen? The word  brazen  means  without shame.  Leeana Tankersley wants women to be just that  to unapologetically move from shame  and fear based living toward lives that are based on love and belonging.
