From conflicted sibling relationships to the choice not to have children, Safer s work has always been unflinching in its aim to dive deep into topics that make most of us blush, but which are present in all of our lives. In The Golden Condom, Safer turns her sharp and fearless eye to a subject perhaps more universal than any other love in all its permutations.In The Golden Condom Safer interweaves her own experiences with those of a variety of memorable people, including her patients, telling a series of tales that investigate relationships  both healthy and toxic  that most of us don t escape life without experiencing at least once, including traumatic friendships, love after loss, unrequited or obsessional love and more.
