Now, he s sure he ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate the planet while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded on Mars  surface, completely alone, with no way to signal Earth that he s alive. And even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone years before a rescue could arrive.Chances are, though, Mark won t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment or plain old  human error  are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark s not ready to quit. Armed with nothing but his ingenuity and his engineering skills  and a gallows sense of humor that proves to be his greatest source of strength he embarks on a dogged quest to stay alive, using his botany expertise to grow food and even hatching a mad plan to contact NASA back on Earth.As he overcomes one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next, Mark begins to let himself believe he might make it off the planet alive.But Mars has plenty of surprises in store for him yet.Grounded in real, present day science from the first page to the last, yet propelled by a brilliantly ingenious plot that surprises the reader again and again, The Martian is a truly remarkable thriller: an impossible to put down suspense novel that manages to read like a real life survival tale. ...more
