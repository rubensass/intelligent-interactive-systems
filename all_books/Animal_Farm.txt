Tired of their servitude to man, a group of farm animals revolt and establish their own society, only to be betrayed into worse servitude by their leaders, the pigs, whose slogan becomes:  All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.  This 1945 satire addresses the socialist/communist philosophy of Stalin in the Soviet Union.
