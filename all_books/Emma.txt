description:
I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall. Beautiful, clever, rich   and single   Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr. Knig  I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall. Beautiful, clever, rich   and single   Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage.
