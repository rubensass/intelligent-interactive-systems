That’s the promise of Join, a revolutionary technology that allows small groups of minds to unite, forming a single consciousness that experiences the world through multiple bodies. But as two best friends, Chance and Lucky, living in an alternate version of our own near future quickly discover, the light of that miracle may be blinding them to its horrors.Jolted out of comfortable, professional routines by a brutal encounter with a terrifying stranger and a malfunction in the join technology, Chance and Lucky follow a faint trail of clues off the grid in their desperate search for a cure. Their journey leads them into the scarred heart of the North American continent.

With the planet descending into environmental ruin, their trust of each other becomes their only guide through the moral hazards of a society in which individual identity has come undone. Along the way, they must confront their own long-buried secrets, and learn how their story of injured conscience connects them to the arc of human evolution.A deftly crafted, kaleidoscopic novel with the pulse of a thriller, Join explores big ideas in the current zeitgeist on an intimate, human scale. ...more
