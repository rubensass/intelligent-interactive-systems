description:
On a languid midsummer s day in the countryside, old Adam Godley, a renowned theoretical mathematician, is dying.

His family gathers at his bedside: his son, young Adam, struggling to maintain his marriage to a radiantly beautiful actress; his nineteen year old daughter, Petra, filled with voices and visions as she waits for the inevitable; their mother, Ursula, whose relations with the Godley children are strained at best; and Petra s  young man   very likely more interested in the father than the daughter  who has arrived for a superbly ill timed visit.But the Godley family is not alone in their vigil. Around them hovers a family of mischievous immortals  among them, Zeus, who has his eye on young Adam s wife; Pan, who has taken the doughy, perspiring form of an old unwelcome acquaintance; and Hermes, who is the genial and omniscient narrator:  We too are petty and vindictive,  he tells us,  just like you, when we are put to it.  As old Adam s days on earth run down, these unearthly beings start to stir up trouble, to sometimes wildly unintended effect. . . . Blissfully inventive and playful, rich in psychological insight and sensual detail, The Infinities is at once a gloriously earthy romp and a wise look at the terrible, wonderful plight of being human  a dazzling novel from one of the most widely admired and acclaimed writers at work today. ...more
