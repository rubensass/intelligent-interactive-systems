She has written to say she is in hospice and wanted to say goodbye. Leaving his tense, bitter wife Maureen to her chores, Harold intends a quick walk to the corner mailbox to post his reply but instead, inspired by a chance encounter, he becomes convinced he must deliver his message in person to Queenie  who is 600 miles away  because as long as he keeps walking, Harold believes that Queenie will not die.

And will Queenie be alive to see Harold arrive at her door? ...more
